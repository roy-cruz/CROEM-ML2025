# CROEM ML 2025 Workshop

This repository holds the material developed for the CROEM Student ML 2025 Workshop. The material can be accessed through the generated static webpage. The core lessons of this material are in the form of Jupyter Notebooks which can be run by either opening a particular notebook in Google Colab by clicking the included badge, [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](), or by cloning the repository and running the notebooks locally through in your own virtual environment.

If you are working to develop the material of this workshop and you wish to see how the final webpage will look like, you can build it by following the instructions in [Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/build.html).
