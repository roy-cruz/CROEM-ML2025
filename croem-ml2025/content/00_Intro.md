# Introduction

## How ML is shaping our world

Machine learning is a powerful tool that has become ubiquotous in our day to day life. From the algorithms in Instagram determining what to show you based on your interest, to the image recognition software your phone uses to organize pictures, to the very popular ChatGPT which has started to rival Google's search engine (which also uses ML!), ML is everywhere in our modern age. Its influence has not been restricted to the tools we use every day, but it has also been key to the many scientific discoveries. It has and is being used in many of the breakthroughs shaping our world today:

## Why is ML so powerful?

Suppose that you are receiving a lot of spam in your email and you want to find a way to automatically flag emails as spam. The conventional approach would go something like this:

1. Identify what typical spam looks like. You could write down all of the typical words and phrases used in these emails (i.e. "free", "act now", "winner" and "rich").
2. Write an algorithm which looks for these words and phrases in an email and, if any are found, that email would be flagged.

This approach presents some immediate difficulty. For instance, how are you supposed to make a comprehensive list of words and phrases? And what if, after you're done with your list, scammers notice that their emails are getting flagged if they used a particular phrase, so they change it slightly so that it is no longer captured by your algorithm. You'd need endlessly tweak and fine-tune your list and spam-detecting algorithm, continuously updating it to capture all cases. This is not a good approach!

```python
flag_words = ["free", "winner", "rich"]
email = """
Hello! We are reaching out to you to let you know that you are the winner of a free car! Act now, because another person might claim it before you do!
"""
email_words = email.split(" ")

spam = False

for flag_word in flag_words:
    if flag_word in email_words:
        print("Potential spam found!")
```

An alternate approach to solve this problem would be to ditch the strict list of words and instead teach your computer how to identify spam emails without programming a strict set of rules. This is what machine learning (ML) allows us to do. A potential approach would be as follows:
1. Have a bunch of example emails, some of which are spam and other which are not (more on that later!).
2. Train your ML algorithm (more on that later!) with a portion of this example data.
3. Evaluate the trained algorithm by running it on the rest of the data and seeing how it performs.
4. If needed, re-train or tweak model until you reach the desired performance.

This approach is particularly powerful because the re-training fo the ML algorithm can be automated and keeping it up to date is feasible.

As can be seen from this simple example, ML turns traditional problem-solving on its head. In classical programming, we define a set of rules or functions that map inputs to outputs.

    A["Data ($$x$$)"] --> C
    C{"$$f(x)$$"} --> D["Output"]
```

However, with ML, we can ask: "what is the *function* that maps the inputs to the output?" This involves two steps:
1. Training the model: Teach the model how to correctly map inputs to outputs.
    ```{mermaid}

        A["Input $$\;x_i$$"] --> B{"ML Model ($$f(x;h)$$)"}
        B --> C["Predicted output $$\;\hat{y}_i$$"]
        C --> D["Compare actual output to predicted $$\;E(\hat{y}_i, y_i)$$"]
        D --> |"Update model to reduce $$\;E$$"|B
    ```
2. Testing the model: Show data to the model that it has never seen before. Make sure that the model is still performing well.
    ```{mermaid}

    ```
3. Deploy model: With the generalizability of the model ensured, it can be we can now go ahead and use it!

## What will we be learning?

At the end of this workshop you should:

1. Understand the fundamental principles behind ML.
2. Be familiar with some basic ML models that are commonly used and serve as basis for other, more advanced models.
3. Be able to solve simple problems with ML.
